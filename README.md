## CASE: CNN Acceleration for Speech-Classification in Edge-Computing ([Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9658881))

This repository is the guidance for the implementation of casenet on [M-KUBOS](https://www.paltek.co.jp/design/original/m-kubos/index.html) Device.

There are three step to implement Machine Learning (ML) model on M-KUBOS Device:

1. Training the CNN model in PyTorch framework.
2. Making the Hardware logic for M-KUBOS FPGA using Vivado.
3. Implementating the Python application program on the M-KUBOS Device.
